<p>Hey.</p>

<h2>About me</h2>
<p>
    My name is Laura, and I am a software engineer with over 10 years of 
    experience in various areas of .NET development. I am passionate about 
    writing code and I have extensive, in-depth knowledge about C# and .NET.
</p>

<p>
    I don’t just want to write code; I want to write code <em>well</em>. I don’t
    shy away from fixing bugs and maintaining/upgrading legacy code, and I have 
    pushed for unit testing, test-driven development, better coding guidelines 
    and code reviews in the past. While inexperienced, I’m also interested in 
    information security as well as UI/UX design.
</p>

<p>
    I have a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/story/vivelin" target="_blank">Developer Story</a> 
    over at StackOverflow. My full CV is available upon request.
</p>

<h2>Vivelin</h2>
<p>
    On the internet, I go by <b>Vivelin</b>. I am passionate about video games<a 
    href="#steam"><sup>[1]</sup></a><a href="#ffxiv"><sup>[2]</sup></a>, music<a 
    href="#lastfm"><sup>[3]</sup></a>, and I spend a lot of time with my 
    wonderful girlfriend.
</p>

<p>
    One of my recent projects is a more casual, accessible version of the <a 
    asp-page="/Projects/SMZ3">Super Metroid & A Link to the Past crossover 
    randomizer</a>. It combines <i>Super Metroid</i> and <i>A Link of the Past</i>
    into a single game. My version of it makes it more casual and approachable,
    has a built-in voice-enabled item tracker and contains contributions from 
    community members that were not accepted into the original version.
